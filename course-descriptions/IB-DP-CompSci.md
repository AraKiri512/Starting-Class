#### An IB DP Course

Computer science is regarded as an experimental science, alongside biology, chemistry, design technology, physics and environmental systems and societies. All computer science students will work with other students of group 4 subjects (physics, chemistry, biology and design technology).

The IB computer science course is a rigorous and practical problem-solving discipline. Computational thinking lies at the heart of the course and is integrated with other topics. This will be supported by practical activities including programming. On Externally assessed papers, algorithmic thinking will only be externally assessed at the level of pseudo-code. Practical programming experience will be an essential element of developing higher-level thinking skills; this is assessed as a part of the internal assessment. There is no designated language.
 
The MYP technology and design courses develop skills linked to the design cycle, which provides the model of thinking and the strategy used to help students investigate problems and design, plan, create and evaluate the product. Students continuing on to the IB Diploma Programme will have experienced the use of the design cycle and will have developed critical-thinking and design skills, which they will be able to apply and extend in computer science. The Diploma Programme computer science course requires students to become actively involved in, and to focus on, the whole design process as well as the final product, building on the skills acquired during the MYP technology course. In order to complete the IB Diploma Programme computer science internal assessment successfully, students are expected to create a solution to a specific problem using the design cycle, which extends the range of skills developed in MYP technology.

There is no one scientific method of gaining knowledge or of finding explanations for the behaviour of the natural world. Computer science works through a variety of approaches to produce these explanations, but they all rely on data from observations and have a common underpinning rigour, whether using inductive or deductive reasoning. Computer science requires freedom of thought and open-mindedness, and an essential part of the process of science is the way the international computer science community shares ideas through academic papers, conferences and open forums.

#### Course Tools

For the course, we will use JavaScript as our primary language. This will partner with HTML and CSS. With expansive use across the world due to rapid explosion of the web in the late 90's and early 00's, library support is extensive and varied. New powerful libraries and frameworks, like Ryan Dahl's Node.js and GitHub's Electron respectively, have pushed the lanauge's prior limitations. JavaScript is positioned to become the next super language. 

As we work with JavaScript, we'll predominately work with GitHub's Atom IDE. We'll also work directly with GitHub's online repository system to store code and documentation. Completed coursework will be submitted to ManageBac. While IB has a specific order they've listed content, our order won't be exactly the same. General recommendation from other teachers is to learn about and practice programming throughout the course, and I absolutely agree with it.



#### Rough Outline of Curriculum
 
Our Computer Science course is designed to be an introduction into the ideas and fundamentals of programming for students with limited to no background in programming. That being said, students are expected to have previous knowledge of computers in general, and should be able to utilize basic everyday software and operating systems. No background in specialized software is required.
 
All students will learn how to create multiple programs by the end of the course. Students will have to plan and design their own programs, both independently and in working with others. The concepts of computer science and programming are embedded into the creation of various programs, there is an increased focus on planning, researching, and creating products in comparison to other Computer Science programs.

Our Computer Science II course spans across 2 semesters. The course is broken up into 2 massive units.

**Fall Unit: Programming & Graphics**
* Work with graphics libraries
* Create simple fractals
* Build basic GUI's
* Design a graphics-oriented program

**Spring Unit: Programming and Data Visualization**
* Work with visualization libraries
* Lean the basics of data-science
* Design a program that visualizes data

For the traditional American education system, this is an elective. An elective does not mean you get a free A. An elective actually means you don't have to pass. You can excel in, barely pass, or fail this class. Which ever result you choose to pursue will be on your transcript, will affect your GPA, and will be included in what is sent to colleges and universities.
 
To IB, this subject area is just as important as any other, and should require rigorous and significant course work. You are expected to put forth a valiant effort consistently during class and throughout the year. The grade is a reflection of your choices; good or bad.

#### Style of Instruction:
Majority of content will be delivered through video instruction. This allows you to revisit content as often as you need, as well as to be able to slow down, speed up, or repeat content as often as you need. This also allows your instructor to work with and help students or groups of students when they need, without stopping the content for the rest of students.
 
As you are able to work at your own pace, this can sometimes cause a general slowdown for some students. Despite being able to watch videos whenever you need, it is important that you keep up with the pace of the course to not end up with a ton of backwork to complete at the midterm or at term's end.

#### Lab Hours

Lab hours available for extra time or additional help. If you need guidance, please schedule an appointment. If you just need extra work time, pop-ins are allowed. If you choose not to work in class and are a distraction to others, and then ask to come in for extra time, you will likely be denied extra time. You should make use of the time you already have in scheduled class before requesting more.

Before School: Tuesday - Thursday
* 7:15 - 7:45 am

Lunch: A Days Only
* 12:55 - 1:30 pm

After School: Monday, Tuesday, & Thursday
* 3:15 - 4:00 pm

If you need other accommodations, please see your instructor to make an appointment.

#### Cheating & Academic Dishonesty

##### Copyright & Intellectual Property:

All forms of academic dishonesty and cheating are taken seriously. Some forms of cheating and academic dishonesty are more self-explanatory than others. When it comes to art, many students struggle with understanding intellectual property. As such, it is generally recommended to avoid using copyrighted materials without first discussing it with your instructor.
 
Many students are under the belief that if it is for education, copyright and intellectual property laws don't apply. This is not the case. Many companies choose not to file charges when copyright or intellectual property laws are violated for educational use, but some companies do, and this doesn't mean they can't choose to at a later point in time. Use of other's works as your own, without proper documentation can result in loss of credit. However, use of copyrighted material can also result in legal issues in addition to any academic woes.

##### Collaboration vs Collusion:

All forms of academic dishonesty and cheating are taken seriously. Some forms of cheating and academic dishonesty are more self-explanatory than others. The form of academic dishonesty that seems to confuse students is collusion. Collusion is providing or receiving unauthorized aid or assistance. What is or isn't authorized can vary from course to course, so it is important that you communicate with, and understand the expectations of, your instructor.
 
Research, as well as personal experience, shows that students tend to understand content better when working with and discussing content with other students. Some assignments will actually require it. However, it is important that the aid and assistance you receive, or that you provide, is authorized. If you are physically touching another student's keyboard, mouse, or sending complete or partial chunks of code, you are likely engaging in collusion, not collaboration. If unsure, it's better to ask. Collusion is a form of academic dishonesty and can result in loss of credit for all parties involved.
